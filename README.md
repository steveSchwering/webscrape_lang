# webscrape_lang
Repository of webscraping tools for measuring language experiences. The folders in this repository contain different chunks of code designed to access different text from different kinds of common websites that contain useful linguistic information.

The `extract_browser_history` and `scrape_history` folders contain scripts to access your computer's webbrowsing history and to scrape the websites contained within that webbrowsing history, respectively.

The `Goodreads` folder contains a set of scrapers to access book information on Goodreads. This information may be useful to cross-reference with self-reported reading experiences or a list of books extracted from Goodreads, itself.

The `fb_messages` and `yt_cc` folders contain a set of scripts to parse messages downloaded from Facebook's data tools, where you can access the data Facebook has from your profile, as well as a set of scrapers for Youtube closed captions. These two sets of scrapers are unfinished, though potentially interesting or useful.
